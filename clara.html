        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p>Microplastic Water Contamination Prevention</p>

        <h3>Timeframe</h3>
        <p>Jan 2019 - May 2020</p>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Laundry contaminates water supply with microplastics that cause adverse health effects when consumed.</p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>At my university, students are required to take two semesters of IPRO, which stands for inter-professional project. My IPRO team consisted of myself, a programming student, and three other students from various majors: engineering, biology, and architecture. Together, we identified a problem, researched, then designed and tested a solution.

        <p>We decided to focus on our problem from an offensive perspective. We wanted to prevent microplastic contamination from one of the most prevalent sources: laundry machines.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, our research led us to the creation of a laundry filter that is inserted into your machine and collects microfibers and microplastics before they can drain into our water supply. In order to manage the collection and repurposing of the microplastics, we developed a subscription based business model that would send new filters and receive used ones from customers on a monthly basis. Testing with our filters showed a reduction in microplastics entering water from a laundry machine by 95%.</p>

        <p>During development, I was responsible for creating a business model and brand identity for our product. Now, I develop Clara as a personal project in graphic and material design.</p>
