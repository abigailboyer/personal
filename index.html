          <h3>Starfleet Academy</h3>
          <p class="subtitle">React.js Student Portal</p>
          <p>Starfleet Academy is a traditional student portal for a fictional university. Designed using Figma and developed with React, this web app utilizes React Router, Hooks, and Firebase API to create a functional multipage student portal. Authenticated users can send messages to one another as well as sign up for classes and complete degree requirements using an API that I created.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated recently from Illinois Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Information Technology and Management. I specialized in web development and minored in philosophy, both for the same reason: Iâ€™m passionate about considering complex questions and finding their best solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I live in Omaha, NE, and I work for Oriental Trading Company as a User Experience Intern. My job functions revolve around making accessibility updates to our website including creating a new hover and focus state to meet W3 guidelines and creating a new design process for banner images on the website that eliminates the need for using text inside images.
