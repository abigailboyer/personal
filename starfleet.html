        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Starfleet Academy is a traditional student portal for a fictional university. Designed using Figma and developed with React, this web app utilizes React Router, Hooks, and Firebase API to create a functional multipage student portal. Authenticated users can send messages to one another as well as sign up for classes and complete degree requirements using an API that I created.</p>

      <h2>Languages & Tools</h2>
      <h3>React.js</h3>
      <p>I started this project to teach myself React.</p>

      <h3>Firebase API</h3>
      <p>User authentication services, messaging, etc.</p>

      <h3>API</h3>
      <p>After struggling with Firebase for several months, I realized that it wasn't going to serve all of the unique needs of my project. Without an available low-cost reational database to work with, I decided to transfer my courses to an API that I created.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>Using Firebase's authentication services, a user can sign up by entering an email address. Additional information about the user is kept in a realtime database, such as their homeplanet and species.</p>

      <h3>Track Selection</h3>
      <p>After a user signs up, they can choose a track which is essentially a degree specialization. Selecting a track creates a database entry in Firebase for the student that will track their degree progress over time.</p>

      <h3>Course Selection</h3>
      <p>After selecting a degree specialization, users can then sign up for classes. I create all of the class titles and descriptions myself. Currently, there are only a few classes to pick from, but I'm working on adding more to the API.</p>

      <h3>Messaging</h3>
      <p>The messaging service will use Firebase to allow users to send and receive messages in realtime. This feature is currently under construction.</p>

      <h2>Progress</h2>
      <p>I've been working on this project in my spare time for over a year now. Some of the updates I'm working on right now are adding the messaging feature and creating more classes so that the course selection will be functional once completed.</p>
